<div class="post">
	DISCLAIMER: VERY OLD MMORPG CODE<br>
	This script I wrote in order to basically put a lock onto each admin's individual account that is not <br>
	stored anywhere in the client source and is up to the admin to remember. This is to prevent someone from <br>
	hacking into the admin's account and abusing all their power.<br>
	<br>
	In your client find<br>
	<div class="code">
		if word 1 of TheText = "/ignore" then<br>
			<br>
			Ignore(theText)<br>
			put "" into field member "SendChat"<br>
			exit<br>
			<br>
		end if<br>
	</div>
	Under that, place: <br>
	<div class="code">
		if word 1 of TheText = "/code" then<br>
			set TheCodeUsed = word 2 of TheText<br>
			gConnect.sendNetMessage("system.scripts", "Codes", TheCodeUsed)<br>
			set TheText = "Checking to see if code '" & TheCodeUsed & "' is a valid code..."<br>
			AddToChat(TheText)<br>
		end if<br>
		put "" into field member "SendChat"<br>
		exit<br>
	</div>
	Then, in your global scripts find:<br>
	<div class="code">
		"Codes":<br>
		  set MyName = string(user.name)<br>
		  Set TheCodeUsed = string(fullmsg.content)<br>
		  if MyName = "(An Admin Name)" then<br>
			<br>
			if TheCodeUsed = "(Code Here)" then<br>
			  Set CodeTrue = TRUE<br>
			  movie.sendMessage(MyName, "CodeCheck", CodeTrue)<br>
			end if<br>
			<br>
			if TheCodeUsed <> "(Same code)" then<br>
			  Set CodeTrue = FALSE<br>
			  movie.sendMessage(MyName, "CodeCheck", CodeTrue)<br>
			end if<br>
		end if<br>
	</div>
	Return to your source file and find 'if newMessage.subject contains "Broadcast" then'<br>
	and place this underneath:<br>
	<div class="code"><br>
		if newMessage.subject = "CodeCheck" then<br>
        set CodeBeingChecked = string(newMessage.content)<br>
        if CodeBeingChecked = TRUE then<br>
          set IAmUberDuber = TRUE<br>
          set TheText = "The code you entered has granted you Staff Control"<br>
          AddToChat(TheText)<br>
        end if<br>
        if CodeBeingChecked = FALSE then<br>
          Set IAmUberDuber = FALSE<br>
          Set TheText = "Sorry, the code you used is invalid."<br>
          AddToChat(theText)<br>
        end if<br>
      end if<br>
	 </div>
	 Now in the scripts of things like World Editor place IAmUberduber<br>
	 in the globals and have the script check to make sure it's true before<br>
	 it proceeds to open or use the script
</div>
